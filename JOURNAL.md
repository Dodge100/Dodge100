## 10/4/2025 - planned layout  

spent a bit of time looking at existing 60%'s and used them to help make this one. most of it is standard except for the inclusion of the extra keys in the hop layer and using the caps lock key to switch between the two layers. the spacebar is also split since that should allow me to use the space as a modifier key if i press both at the same time.
